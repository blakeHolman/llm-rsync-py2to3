#  The condition of the following if statement
#  follows the word if, and ends with a colon (:)
#  In this example, if x has a value equal to 'spam',
#  then 'Hi spam' will be printed.

x = 'spam'
if x == 'spam':
    print 'Hi spam'
else:
    print 'not spam'

# Notice the indentation (spacing out) of this code.
# The statement(s) following the if condition (i.e. boolean expression)
# must be indented to the next tab stop. This means you must press
# the Tab button before typing the word print.
# Try removing the tab spaces and see what happens when you attempt to run.
